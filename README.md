# Battle Radio Announcer Revival
> This mod is the unofficial update of Battle Radio Announcer, which author has been inactive on GameBanana for 7 years, leading the mods not being updated for latest TF2 version, which uses new `.mp3` format as well as custom folder feature. This unofficial update also adds support for [Team Fortress 2 Classic](https://tf2classic.com/), thanks to the legacy wav format not being changed for that mod.

The idea here is that since you are part of a semi-military group of combatants, you would think that at least someone would know how to operate a radio or walkie-talkie or something along those lines.

Made to sound as natural as possible, so it only replaces what a foot soldier would know. What ever the omnipotent announcer knows, she (or he) will broadcast over her radio. Plus I think it sounds better.

The preview is what the attackers will hear if they are pushing the bomb cart. This pack is technically done but can always be updated to include more voice ques if anyone would want that.

*Update* - After a really long wait, I finally got down to uploading it. More soldier comments as requested. (THIS DOES NOT COMPLETELY REPLACE THE ANNOUNCER, ONLY SOME OF HER (or his) LINES HAVE BEEN REPLACED)
